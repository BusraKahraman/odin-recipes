          Steps

        <ol class="ml-4 list-decimal marker:font-bold">
          <li>
            Gather all ingredients, and preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175
            degrees C).
          </li>
          <li>
            Bring water and rice to a boil in a covered saucepan. Reduce heat to
            low and simmer until rice is tender, about 20 minutes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Meanwhile, heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add ground beef
            and cook until evenly browned and crumbly, 7 to 9 minutes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Hollow out bell peppers by removing and discarding the tops, seeds,
            and membranes. Slice the bottoms of the peppers if necessary to make
            sure they stand up straight.
          </li>
          <li>
            Arrange peppers in a baking dish with the hollowed sides facing
            upward.
          </li>
          <li>
            Prepare filling by mixing cooked beef, cooked rice, 1/2 of the
            tomato sauce, Worcestershire sauce, garlic powder, onion powder,
            salt, and pepper. Spoon an equal amount of filling into each
            hollowed pepper.
